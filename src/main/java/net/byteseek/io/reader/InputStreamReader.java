/**
 * A WindowReader extending {@link AbstractCacheReader} over an {@link java.io.InputStream}
 * .
 * <p>
 * The implementation is stream-friendly, in that it does not need to know the
 * length of the stream in order to serve bytes out of it for any position in
 * the stream. If a position requested has not yet been read in the stream, then
 * the stream will be read (and the Windows encountered cached) until the
 * position requested is available in a {@link net.byteseek.io.reader.windows.HardWindow}. Note that if you
 * explicitly call the {@link #length()} method, then the stream will be read
 * until the end is encountered and a length can be determined.
 * <p>
 * By default, the InputStreamReader uses a {@link TwoLevelCache}, with a
 * {@link net.byteseek.io.reader.cache.LeastRecentlyUsedCache} as its primary cache, and a
 * {@link TempFileCache} as its secondary cache. If the input stream fits
 * entirely into the MostRecentlyUsedCache, then a temporary file will never be
 * created. The secondary cache only gets used if a Window drops out of the
 * primary cache due to exceeding its capacity.
 * <p>
 * Note that if you provide your own WindowCache to this WindowReader, then you should
 * either be sure that it is always possible to retrieve an earlier Window from
 * the cache (since it is not possible to rewind all InputStreams), or be sure
 * that in the use you make of this WindowReader, a position which is no longer
 * available in your cache will never be requested. If you request a position
 * which has already been read in the stream, but which the cache can no longer
 * provide, then a {@link net.byteseek.io.reader.windows.WindowMissingException} will be thrown (this is a
 * RuntimeException, as it indicates a programming error).
 * <p>
 * This class depends on InputStream implementations, which are unlikely to be
 * thread-safe.
