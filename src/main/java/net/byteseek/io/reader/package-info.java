/**
 * A package which provides a consistent random-access interface over a variety of
 * input sources including Files, InputStreams, SeekableByteChannels, Strings and byte arrays.
 * <p>
 * The input source is chunked on demand into windows over the data, which each encapsulate a byte array.
 * This allows clients to access the arrays directly, and for the windows
 * to be cached using a variety of caching strategies defined in the cache sub-package.
 * <p>
 * Input sources which are already support random access just fetch the appropriate window on demand.
 * Input sources which are not random access will directly return a Window which has already been read, or will
 * read forward (caching as they go) to obtain a new Window which has not yet been read.  Care must be taken to
 * select cache strategies that will be able to return any Window the application requests again.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of Window currently defined.  HardWindows store a hard reference
 * to the underlying byte array.  SoftWindows use a SoftReference to the array, which allows
 * the garbage collector to re-use the array memory if it is not currently in use.  For
 * applications which are processing byte sources quickly, SoftWindows may help to prevent
 * OutOfMemoryErrors.  Otherwise, they simply add IO overhead as windows may need to be re-read.
 * <p>
 * In addition, the WindowInputStream adapts any WindowReader into an InputStream, to allow the
 * cached windows to be used with other classes which require input streams.
