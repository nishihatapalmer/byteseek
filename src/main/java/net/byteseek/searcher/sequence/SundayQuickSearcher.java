/**
 * An implementation of the Sunday Quick searcher algorithm described in
 * "A very fast substring search algorithm", by SUNDAY D.M., 1990.
 * <p>
 * It is a modification of the Horspool search algorithm.  Sunday realised that you can shift on the
 * position one past the end of the pattern, not just on the end of the pattern.  Although this leads to larger
 * shifts, in practice the algorithm does not obtain better performance than plain Horspool.
 * <p>
 * This well illustrates one of the core tensions in search algorithm design.
 * Although there can be a theoretical boost to performance, it does not always translate into better performance in practice.
 * This is often due to greater processing complexity, more memory accesses, worse memory cache hits,
 * or code which cannot be optimised as well to run on the underlying hardware for some other reason.
 * <p>
 * There is no good reason to choose this other than curiosity on search algorithm design and performance.
 * All the other algorithms in byteseek will almost always outperform it, other than the naive search.
