/**
 * An iterator over search results, given a Searcher and byte array or WindowReader to search over.
 * Each iteration returns a list of MatchResults.  Some searchers can return more than one match for a single
 * position, e.g. if a multi-sequence searcher is used.
 * <p>
 * Static utility methods for finding all matches in data with a searcher are provided for convenience.
  <p>
 * Note that the List of MatchResults returned on each iteration is the same list object each time.
 * On each iteration the list is cleared and the new results appended.  This avoids creating a new
 * list for each search iteration.  If you want to retain the MatchResults across iterations,
 * you should add them to a master list which you seperately maintain.
 * <p>
 * Design note: this class does not implement the standard Java Iterator interface.
 * This is because IOExceptions can occur during searching, and the Iterator interface does not permit
 * checked exceptions to be thrown. Rather than go around this in some way, we prefer to be familiar but not deceptive.
